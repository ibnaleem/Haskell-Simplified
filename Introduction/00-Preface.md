# PREFACE

_Feel free to skip my preface that outlines the motivation and inspiration for creating Haskell-Simplified._ Go to *[Installing Haskell](./01-Installing%20Haskell)*.

## Programming Paradigms
I was automatically enrolled for *Intro to Programming* for my first-year in Computer Science. I initially thought this module covered Java since I read online that one of the modules would focus on Java. However, I later discovered that Java is taught in our second year for CS, and the *Intro to Programming* module actually covered Python... a language I'm extremely proficient in. I learned that I can switch "Intro to Programming" for a more advanced course, namely *Programming Paradigms*. After making the switch, our lecturer introduced us to the course and the many *programming paradigms* that exist in CS. I always assumed all programming languages were the same, only different syntax and concepts, but to learn that there was a paradigm called *functional programming* threw me off a bit.

Programming paradigms are different ways to write code. Functional programming is when you use functions like in math, and avoid changing things in your code. Read *Intro to Haskell* to learn more about functional programming.

## Self-Learning
The goal of Haskell-Simplified isn't only to teach you functional programming in Haskell, **but also myself,** struggling to understand this new programming paradigm I wish I hadn't touched. I've always known that teaching others is the best way to teach yourself, since you have to simplify complex concepts to help others comprehend them, which helps you understand the concepts as well. 

## Inspiration
If you've ever read [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) (you should if you haven't), you'd find various similarities with Haskell-Simplified; this is because Haskell-Simplied is inspired by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) to teach others Haskell in a simple and comprehensive manner with resources and exercises to help.

##### Thank you for taking the time to read my preface; you can begin your functional programming journey in the next chapter, *[Installing Haskell](./01-Installing%20Haskell)*
