An open-source curriculum for learning functional programming in Haskell. Dive into detailed chapters with hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical knowledge. Showcase completed exercises in your portfolio for practical proof of your skills.

Most chapters blend original written content with material from [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](https://github.com/ibnaleem/CS-Resources/blob/main/Languages/Learn%20You%20a%20Haskell%20for%20Great%20Good.pdf).

This repository contains the actual chapter files used on [our website](https://ibnaleem.github.io/Haskell-Simplified).
